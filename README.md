# 🌳 Collision Detection Using Quadtrees

This project implements an efficient **2D collision detection system** using **QuadTree spatial partitioning**, developed with **Python and Pygame**. It simulates dynamic object interactions like those seen in games or simulations, improving performance and accuracy over brute-force methods.

## 🚀 Features

* 🔄 **Automated and Player-Controlled Movement**
* 🧠 **Efficient Collision Detection** using QuadTree
* 🧱 **Obstacle Management** and path constraints
* 🎨 **Visual Feedback** on collision (color change)
* 📊 **Collision Statistics** displayed in real-time
* 🧪 **Scalable Testing** with varying object densities

---

## 🛠 Components Used

* **Python 3**
* **Pygame** (for rendering, event handling)
* **QuadTree Class** (custom-built for spatial partitioning)
* **Sprites** (for representing game objects like cars, players, and obstacles)

---

## 🧪 Methodology

* 📦 **Sprite-Based Rendering:** All entities inherit from `pygame.sprite.Sprite`.
* 🎮 **Player and Automated Movement:** Player moves manually via arrow keys; automated objects follow predefined paths.
* 🌐 **QuadTree Spatial Partitioning:** The game world is partitioned into quadrants, reducing unnecessary collision checks.
* 📷 **Collision Detection:** QuadTree identifies potential collisions by checking only nearby objects.
* 📺 **Real-Time Visualization:** Collisions are rendered with visual cues and real-time stats.

## 📈 Results

* ✅ QuadTree method significantly reduced computation compared to O(n²) brute-force approaches.
* ⚡ Maintained **O(log n)** performance even as object count increased.
* 🔄 Real-time collisions were efficiently managed and visually displayed.
* 🧩 Scalable and adaptable for high-density simulations or game scenes.
